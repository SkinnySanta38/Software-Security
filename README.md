Respository for CS305 Software Security

•Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

	Artemis financial is a financial company that specializes in individualized financial plans for their customers. They wanted to expand their online presence and provide a secure site for their customers to keep their personal information and documents safe through transit and long-term storage.  

 
•What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

	Security flaws are to be documented when found and studied further to see what causes the vulnerability and what to do to patch it. If an update is able to fix the problem that is often the fastest and easiest option, otherwise a change in the code base necessary. It is hard to directly see the benefits of a secure system for a company until there is an attack that is easily delt with. Security adds a peace of mind knowing the business is safer from being exploited from losing money, information, or customer trust.

 
•What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

	The most challenging aspect of the vulnerability assessment was the amount of vulnerabilities present was overwhelming at first. Once I became accustomed to sorting through the different vulnerabilities, I was able to work more efficiently and get work completed faster.

 
•How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

	In order to increase security, I initially ran a dependency check to check for dependencies that need to be updated, if any still present vulnerabilities but are up to date, they may need to be analyzed for how critical the vulnerability is. If the vulnerability is labeled as critical, a codebase change may be necessary to patch the vulnerability or seek an alternative dependency option. After all vulnerabilities appear to be fixed, rerun the dependency check to see if any new vulnerabilities popped up, and repeat the process for those new vulnerabilities.

 
•How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

	Running individual tests for different aspects being patched is paramount in ensuring patches are actually patching. Once comprehensive tests have been performed, ensuring all found vulnerabilities have been fixed, run another dependency check to see if any other vulnerabilities have popped up. Repeat the process until no more vulnerabilities are found.


•What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

	Mr. Jeremy Long seems to be the man to message if possible since he seems to have done a majority of the work for dependency checks system. Jokes aside, NIST, OWASP, and the NSA are a few very credible and important organizations in the cybersecurity world. These organizations provide information and documents such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) that allow programmers to find and track vulnerabilities and their fixes. Most of these programs and databases that you can, use such dependency check, are free and open source, allowing a wide audience to utilize and contribute to them.


•Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

	This assignment, and overall course, taught me a good basis of cybersecurity as well as practicing documenting everything in see and do. As for the security aspect, encryption has been my favorite thing to have learned and I will be able to use this knowledge in other areas of my personal and work life, such as setting up a password protector on my pc. I have also grown in other aspect such as documenting information and explaining technical terminology into plain language.
